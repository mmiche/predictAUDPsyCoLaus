\title{Prepare prediction stability plot data.}
\usage{
prediction_stability1(x, bounds = 0.95, smooth_bounds = FALSE, span = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Output of function \code{validate} from the \code{pminternal} package.}

\item{bounds}{Width of the 'stability interval' (percentiles of the bootstrap model predictions). NULL = do not add bounds to plot.}

\item{smooth_bounds}{Boolean value (default = FALSE). If TRUE, uses loess to smooth the bounds; see Argument \code{smooth_bounds} in \code{pminternal::prediction_stability}.}

\item{span}{Numeric value. Controls the degree of smoothing (see loess; default = 0.75); see Argument \code{span} in \code{pminternal::prediction_stability}.}
}
\value{
a list with three lists as elements:
\enumerate{
\item b Number of bootstrap repetitions (we used b = 500).
\item stabilDf Dataframe with as many rows as the original data and with b + 1 columns (column 1 = p_app = apparent predicted probability, whereas the remaining b many columns contain the cross-validated predicted probabilities).
\item lims Dataframe with as many rows as the original data and with three columns (names: X2.5., X.97.5, and p_app). In the prediction instability plot, they are shown as the dashed 95 percent stability interval for the estimated risks from the bootstrap models (see Riley and Collins, 2023, section 3.2.1).

Extract data for prediction stability.

\details{
This function is a modification of the function \code{prediction_stability} of the R package \code{pminternal}. The reason to modify it, was that I wanted to visualize the results with ggplot2, not with the R graphics package.
