  dataTest = NULL,
  frmla.f = NULL,
  outcome = "y"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{dataTrain}{Training subset (80 percent) of the full sample.}

\item{dataTest}{Test subset (20 percent) of the full sample.}

\item{frmla.f}{An object of the class \code{formula}, used for the random forest model (f = outcome must be of class \code{factor}).}
