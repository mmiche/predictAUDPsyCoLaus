\title{Prepare MAPE stability plot data.}
\usage{
mape_stability1(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Output of function \code{validate} from the \code{pminternal} package.}
}
\value{
a list with two elements:
\enumerate{
\item mapeDf Dataframe with as many rows as the original data and with two columns (p_app = apparent predicted probabilities from the original full data, individual_mape = mean of the absolute prediction error of each individual).
\item out List with two elements: A vector with the individual mean absolute prediction errors, the overall average MAPE.
}

}
\description{
Extract data for mean average prediction error (MAPE) stability.
}
\details{
This function is a modification of the function \code{mape_stability} of the R package \code{pminternal}. The reason to modify it, was that I wanted to visualize the results with ggplot2, not with the R graphics package.
